	 * Sockets primer...
	 * The socket() call creates an endpoint for TCP of UDP communication. It
	 * returns a descriptor (similar to a file descriptor) that we call fd_listen,
	 * or, "the socket we're listening on for connection requests" in our sss
	 * server example.
	 *
	 * Traditionally, in the Sockets API, PF_INET and AF_INET is used for the
	 * protocol and address families respectively. However, there is usually only
	 * 1 address per protocol family. Thus PF_INET and AF_INET can be interchanged.
	 * In the case of NicheStack, only the use of AF_INET is supported.
	 * PF_INET is not supported in NicheStack.

	if ((fd_listen = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) {
		alt_NetworkErrorHandler(EXPANDED_DIAGNOSIS_CODE,
				"[sss_task] Socket creation failed");
	}


	 * Sockets primer, continued...
	 * Calling bind() associates a socket created with socket() to a particular IP
	 * port and incoming address. In this case we're binding to SSS_PORT and to
	 * INADDR_ANY address (allowing anyone to connect to us. Bind may fail for
	 * various reasons, but the most common is that some other socket is bound to
	 * the port we're requesting.

	addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
	addr.sin_port = htons(SSS_PORT);
	addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

	if ((bind(fd_listen, (struct sockaddr * )&addr, sizeof(addr))) < 0) {
		alt_NetworkErrorHandler(EXPANDED_DIAGNOSIS_CODE,
				"[sss_task] Bind failed");
	}


	 * Sockets primer, continued...
	 * The listen socket is a socket which is waiting for incoming connections.
	 * This call to listen will block (i.e. not return) until someone tries to
	 * connect to this port.

	if ((listen(fd_listen, 1)) < 0) {
		alt_NetworkErrorHandler(EXPANDED_DIAGNOSIS_CODE,
				"[sss_task] Listen failed");
	}

	 At this point we have successfully created a socket which is listening
	 * on SSS_PORT for connection requests from any remote address.

	sss_reset_connection(&conn);
	printf("[sss_task] Simple Socket Server listening on port %d\n", SSS_PORT);

		 * For those not familiar with sockets programming...
		 * The select() call below basically tells the TCPIP stack to return
		 * from this call when any of the events I have expressed an interest
		 * in happen (it blocks until our call to select() is satisfied).
		 *
		 * In the call below we're only interested in either someone trying to
		 * connect to us, or data being available to read on a socket, both of
		 * these are a read event as far as select is called.
		 *
		 * The sockets we're interested in are passed in in the readfds
		 * parameter, the format of the readfds is implementation dependant
		 * Hence there are standard MACROs for setting/reading the values:
		 *
		 *   FD_ZERO  - Zero's out the sockets we're interested in
		 *   FD_SET   - Adds a socket to those we're interested in
		 *   FD_ISSET - Tests whether the chosen socket is set

		FD_ZERO(&readfds);
		FD_SET(fd_listen, &readfds);
		max_socket = fd_listen + 1;

		if (conn.fd != -1) {
			FD_SET(conn.fd, &readfds);
			if (max_socket <= conn.fd) {
				max_socket = conn.fd + 1;
			}
		}

		select(max_socket, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);


		 * If fd_listen (the listening socket we originally created in this thread
		 * is "set" in readfs, then we have an incoming connection request. We'll
		 * call a routine to explicitly accept or deny the incoming connection
		 * request (in this example, we accept a single connection and reject any
		 * others that come in while the connection is open).

		if (FD_ISSET(fd_listen, &readfds)) {
			sss_handle_accept(fd_listen, &conn);
		}

		 * If sss_handle_accept() accepts the connection, it creates *another*
		 * socket for sending/receiving data over sss. Note that this socket is
		 * independant of the listening socket we created above. This socket's
		 * descriptor is stored in conn.fd. If conn.fs is set in readfs... we have
		 * incoming data for our sss server, and we call our receiver routine
		 * to process it.

			if ((conn.fd != -1) && FD_ISSET(conn.fd, &readfds)) {
				sss_handle_receive(&conn);
